I am a passionate, hard worker, and motivated junior software developer with a deep-rooted passion for my own self-development. I really enjoy creating a clean and test-driven code in a stimulating work environment to build products and services consumers can enjoy and I am a strong believer in teamwork.

I spent almost my all life in my native country, Italy, where in the last 6 years I worked as a Client Coach and Sales Representative for one of the biggest Italian telecommunications companies - [TIM](https://www.tim.it)

During this long experience, I worked with a multitude of technologies such as Smartphone, IoT, Google Home, Drones, Smartwatch, Computers but also set contracts about fiber broadband, Sky, Google Nest for private customers and companies.

I enrolled in [Makers Academy](https://www.makers.tech) Bootcamp, where I quickly learned engineering best practices, tools, and methodologies and the importance of deconstruct big problems into small ones and solve them in order to solve the bigger coding issue. I also discovered how much I enjoy learn new technologies and apply them to my projects.

Thanks to that experience I started to be curious about what is  ' behind the technologies ' I worked with for many years and as soon arrived in the UK, I decided that will be my new career.

## Skills

### Team Work / Emotion Intelligence 

Working in different stores and with different teams during my career allowed me to constantly improve my soft-skill, which I consider as important as technical skills.
In the past, I found myself often meeting with my colleagues where we had to decide the best strategy for achieving our monthly targets, which services to implement in order to find the best feedback from our customers, and even decide if and when to quickly change strategy if something suddenly happened.
During this amazing experience, I developed a strong passion and curiosity about the tech world in general but also learned how important soft-skills are, communicate well with customers, understand quickly their issues, and find the best solution for their needs.


Even during my Bootcamp, pairing with other students every day forced me to understand the people first, help them if I knew something more, and continuously ask questions if I did not understand a concept. 
I also had many formative experiences in different shops around my country where understanding the different team's dynamics and needs was fundamental for developing my own team-skills and apply what I learned in own my team.
I currently attend weekly process workshops and reviews with other students and coaches continuing to learn and share new concepts and methodologies.

During this difficult moments for everybody, where most of the work is decentralized, is more important than ever to create and support a healthy team-work environment and being a true believer in the balances that each team has.

### Problem Solving 

Setting new strategies and plans in order to achieve goals has always been the approach that I tried to have at my previous jobs and fortunately, is also the first mental approach learned at Makers, 'is not hard is just new'.
Deconstructing a big problem in smaller parts, deciding which technologies to use in order to solve our problems is one of the kye-concepts of the TDD development process and we were oriented to stick to this amazing practice during the entire period of the Bootcamp. As Client Coach and Sales Representative we were the first customer care, the direct filter between the company and customers so many times for contractual problems, hard-ware and software issues we as the employee had to manage the situation, deconstruct the problem and based on the customer's input decide the best strategy apply for that specific situation and solve problems as fast as possible.

### Self driven learning

Constantly during our Bootcamp, we had to learn new technologies, languages, testing framework, and methodologies and most of our time was center on solo learning moments with the possibility, during our pair sessions, to share our knowledge. Personally before and after my Makers experience, I worked as a waiter and set my days in order to self-learn JS server-side and improve my NodeJS skills. In my previous job in Italy every month we received guide-lines to learn new plans and type of contracts the company decided to propose to our customers and those were followed by new functionality to learn on our software but also working with third parties software and systems; when we proposed plans for others on-demand services (Sky, TIM VISION +, Mediaset Premium) we had to learn how those systems work too and become familiar with them as soon as possible.
