I am a passionate, hard working and motivated junior software developer with a deep-rooted passion for my own self-development. I really enjoy creating a clean and test-driven code in a stimulating work environment to build products and services consumers can enjoy and I am a strong believer in teamwork.

I worked for six years as a technical client coach for one of Italy’s biggest Italian telecommunication companies ([TIM](https://www.tim.it)) using a multitude of hardware and software technologies including wearable tech and IoT. I became fascinated in what’s ‘behind the technologies’ and this led me to the UK, where I taught myself to code while working full-time before joining Makers.

I am still fascinated in understanding deeply how these technologies work and now I’m equally obsessed by clean coding principles and deconstructing big problems into solvable problems. I’m excited to continue my own growth in a professional technical team working on solutions to some interesting and difficult challenges.

## Experience

**[TIM](www.tim.it) - Telecom Italia Mobile** - Florence, Italy
(September 2012 – October 2018)  
Client Coach - Sales Representative  


At TIM, I was responsible for  providing a  range of software and hardware solutions to private and corporate companies including smartphones, IoT, Google Home, drones, smartwatches, computers. Core skills included:

* Client Communication: I clearly communicated the benefit of new technologies to our clients  to support them in choosing the right products and services.
* Listening: Developing empathy and deep listening skills allowed me to understand client needs. I was then able to solve technology problems efficiently while building brand loyalty.
* Training  I trained internal and external stakeholders to use new software and digital platforms. 
* Problem-solving: After understanding my client’s software and hardware issues, I needed to quickly find  the most appropriate solution from  a variety of internal and third party platforms.
* Collaboration. I worked strategically with my team and area managers to achieve and exceed monthly targets.







## Skills

### Teamwork & Emotional Intelligence

I consider soft-skills to be as important as technical skills and I’ve been mindful to develop my own EQ through my career. As part of a small client-facing team at Telecom Italia, we were collectively responsible for our sales strategy and often agreed to change our approach in response to new customer feedback. I learned that the most effective way to secure a sale was to listen and understand client needs before suggesting possible solutions. I secured a loyal customer base as a result. I knew I needed to listen carefully to others at Makers, ask questions to ensure my understanding, help and share what I was learning. This is particularly important in a decentralized working environment.

### Problem Solving

Effective goal setting has been a big part of my previous roles and it’s the first mindset we learned at Makers. ‘It’s not hard, it’s just new’.

Test-driven development requires the deconstruction of a problem into smaller parts before deciding what technologies to use to solve those problems. This was familiar to me because problem solving was such a fundamental part of my job as a client coach for Telecom Italia. As the first point of contact for anything from contractual issues to hardware and software questions, I was responsible for deconstructing the problem and solving it as fast as possible. This required a calm, technical approach and using my strong internal relationships throughout the business to find tailoredt solutions to complex problems.. 

### Self driven learning
After I decided to pursue software development as a full-time career, I moved to the UK and taught myself server-side JavaScript and Node.js while working full-time as a waiter. Learning new technical concepts fast was a part of my role at  Telecom Italia. Every month we received technical guidelines for new plans, software and systems. I had not only to understand how these systems worked but to be able to explain them clearly to our clients on a deadline. I’m comfortable learning new skills quickly and I’ve really enjoyed learning new methodologies, testing frameworks and languages at Makers both alone and working in a pair.
