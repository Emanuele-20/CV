---------------


I am a passionate, hard worker and motivated junior software developer with a deep-rooted passion for my own self development. I really enjoy creating clean and test-driven code in a stimulating working environment to build product and services consumers can enjoy and I am a strongly Team Work believer.


I spent almost my all life in my native country, Italy, where in the last 6 years I worked as Client Coach and Retailer for the main italian telecomunication company -  [TIM](https://www.tim.it/)

During this long experince I worked with a multitude of technologies such as Smartphone, Iot, Google Home, Drones, Smartwatch, Computers but also set contracts about for fibre broadband, Sky, Google Nest for private customers and companies.

During this amazing experience I developed a strong passion and curiosity about the tech world in general, but also learn how important are the soft-skills, how important is learn how comunicate with customers, how decisive is understand quickly their issues and find the best solution for their needs.

I also had many formative experiences in different shops around my country where understanding the different teams dynamics and needs was foundamental for developing my own team-skills and apply what I learned in own my team.

Thanks to that experience I started to be curious about what is " behind the tecnologies " I worked with for many years and as soon arrived in UK I decided that will be my new career.

I jumped in  [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) bootcamp, where I quickly learned engineering best practices, tools and methodologies and the importance of deconstruct big problems into small ones and solve them in order to solve the bigger coding issues.
I also discovered how much I enjoy learn new tecnologies and apply them to my projects.
